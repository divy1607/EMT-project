        "\n",
        "* In the context of electrostatics, a corrugated surface refers to a surface\n",
        "   that has a series of ridges and troughs, resembling the shape of waves or corrugations. These surfaces are designed to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of various electrostatic devices or applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) Introducing corrugated surfaces into electrostatic problems using a         perturbative approach can offer several benefits:  \n",
        "\n",
        " *Analytical Insight:* Perturbative methods allow for the systematic analysis of the effects of small perturbations (in this case, the introduction of corrugated surfaces) on the overall electrostatic system. This can provide valuable analytical insights into the behavior of the system, such as changes in electric field distribution, potential energy, or charge distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Simplicity:* Perturbative methods often simplify complex problems by breaking them down into simpler components. By treating the corrugated surface as a perturbation to an existing electrostatic system with a flat surface, the problem becomes more manageable, facilitating the analysis and understanding of the effects of the corrugations.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Quantitative Predictions:* Perturbative approaches can provide quantitative predictions of how the corrugated surface alters various electrostatic properties, such as capacitance, charge distribution, or electric field strength. This allows engineers and researchers to assess the impact of corrugations on the performance of electrostatic devices accurately.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Computational Efficiency:* Perturbative methods can be computationally more efficient compared to numerical simulations, especially for small perturbations. This efficiency enables rapid exploration of different corrugation geometries or parameters, aiding in the optimization of electrostatic devices.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Physical Insights:* By analyzing the perturbed system, researchers can gain deeper insights into the underlying physics of electrostatic interactions with corrugated surfaces. This understanding can lead to the development of novel electrostatic devices with improved performance and efficiency.5"

        "Smooth surfaces can exhibit corrugations that impact their interactions, even on a small scale. For instance, consider a charge near a surface. The image potential, resulting from induced charge distribution, is crucial for forming image potential states, which are quantum states of electrons localized at the surface of materials with negative electron affinity. Understanding the behavior of these electrons can reveal important physical and chemical surface properties. Prior to 1980, most studies of image potential effects assumed planar interfaces between two media, but the presence of deformations modifies the image potential.\n",
        "\n",
        "Perturbative expansions are commonly used in electromagnetism courses, particularly in multipolar expansions. In 1985, Clinton et al. employed a perturbative approach to solve Poisson's equation, calculating the image potential for a point charge in vacuum near a perfectly conducting corrugated surface. Recently, this approach was also used to analyze electron-electron interaction in a 2D system with a corrugated dielectric medium and to study van der Waals interaction between an anisotropic polarizable particle and a nonplanar surface.\n",

        "In this paper, we review the calculations of Clinton et al., aiming to make their results more accessible. We focus on the case of a sinusoidal surface, demonstrating how the potential, electric field, and induced surface charge density are influenced by the corrugated surface. Additionally, we introduce an original contribution by extending this perturbative approach to solve Laplace's equation for the electrostatic potential of a corrugated neutral conducting cylinder in a uniform electric field."
